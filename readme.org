* Goal
We aim to answer the question: Does sphering the morphological profiles improve retrievability?
* Steps
We integrate different modules of pycytominer with Shantanu's sphering.
** Download data
** Fetch specific scripts to preprocess data

* Resources and notes
** Method discussion

The method is
1. estimate sphering transform across all negcon wells from all batches, then apply this transform to all wells (including negcon)
2. estimate a sphering transform per batch (across all negcon wells from the batch), then apply the transform to each corresponding batch

Currently, we do only 1. We discussed: why do 1 at all if we are doing 2? The way to think about is to consider the corresponding data generation model:

Consider the data frame comprising all N batches
X = {X_i} i=1...N
X_i is a n_i x d dimensional matrix (n_i wells x d features)

This X is the true data that we are trying to estimate, but we can observe only Z =  {Z_i} i=1...N
Z_i is a n_i x p dimensional matrix (n_i wells x p features)
To keep this simpler, we assume p = d

Z_i = global_variation(local_variation_i(X_i))

location_variation_i = batch-specific scaling, rotation, and translation of X_i
global_variation = batch-agnostic scaling, rotation, and translation of local_variation_i(X_i)

#1 removes global variation, #2 removes location variation
